1.Conduct a detailed systems investigation to meet the business needs outlined in your chosen scenario:
oGather stakeholder requirements using interviews or surveys.
oDefine project scope including inputs, outputs, processes, constraints, and limitations.
2.Use appropriate software analysis tools (e.g., Context Diagrams, Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)) to document your findings.
3.Trace requirements throughout the lifecycle stages using traceability matrices:
oEnsure that all requirements are tracked from initial gathering through design, implementation, testing, and deployment.
4.Evaluate the effectiveness of your systems investigation in improving software quality:
oDiscuss two approaches for improving software quality (e.g., Total Quality Management (TQM), automated testing).

Deliverables
1. System Implementation and Evaluation Report
You will produce a formal report that includes:
A comprehensive investigation into business needs and stakeholder requirements.
Documentation of software analysis tools/techniques used during the lifecycle (e.g., Context Diagrams, ERDs).
An analysis of how requirements were traced throughout the lifecycle using traceability matrices.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of your systems investigation in improving software quality.
A critical discussion on behavioural design techniques (e.g., FSMs, pseudocode) and their suitability for your project scenario.
Justifications for how data-driven approaches enhance software reliability and effectiveness.
This report must be structured professionally with headings, subsections, diagrams where applicable, and supported by research referenced using the Harvard referencing style.

2. Formal Presentation
Prepare a professional presentation summarizing your findings from the implementation process. The presentation should:
Highlight key outcomes from your systems investigation process.
Discuss the effectiveness of your approach in improving software quality.
Evaluate behavioural design techniques selected for your project scenario.
Justify how data-driven approaches improve system reliability and scalability.
The presentation should consist of:
10–20 slides as a guide.
Speaker notes accompanying each slide to provide context for your discussion.

3. A Simple Prototype
You will develop a functional prototype that demonstrates at least two core features from two clearly distinct functional modules within your system. These modules must represent separate areas of functionality — for example, Login and Register would be considered part of the same Authentication module and do not count as two distinct features.
The prototype will be used during your presentation and live demo to effectively showcase how your system meets both user and technical requirements.

The prototype should:
Represent functional modules that are clearly separated in purpose, such as Authentication, Course Management, User Dashboard, or Reporting.
Demonstrate key functionalities aligned with the system design and stakeholder needs outlined in your report.
Be structured using appropriate design techniques and demonstrate behavioural considerations.
Be interactive enough to illustrate how different parts of the system work together in a realistic context.

Why These Deliverables Are Required
These deliverables reflect real-world practices in software development projects:
1.The System Implementation and Evaluation Report ensures that all aspects of system development are documented comprehensively while providing evidence of how stakeholder requirements are met through proper investigation and design techniques.
2.The Formal Presentation allows you to communicate technical findings effectively to stakeholders or technical audiences—an essential skill in professional environments.
3.The Prototype enables you to demonstrate the practical implementation of your system in a realistic scenario. It showcases your ability to turn design and requirements into working features across distinct system modules. This reflects the expectations of real-world software projects, where tangible proof of functionality is essential to gain stakeholder trust and validate technical decisions.
