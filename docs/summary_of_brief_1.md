# Summary of the Assignment Brief

The assignment brief outlines a vocational scenario where you, as a Software Development Team Lead at TechVision Solutions, are responsible for implementing and evaluating the next phase of a software project following the planning phase. The project focuses on applying the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to one of four scenarios: Hotel Room Booking System, Food Delivery Platform, Learning Management System (LMS), or Hospital Management Software. The goal is to conduct a detailed systems investigation, implement key SDLC stages, evaluate the approach, and produce deliverables to demonstrate technical and professional competencies.

# Key Components

## 1. Project Scenarios (My choice):

- Learning Management System (LMS): Supports course management, student interaction, assessment tools, and analytics.

## 2. Responsibilities:

### 2.1 Systems Investigation:

- Gather stakeholder requirements via interviews/surveys.
- Define project scope (inputs, outputs, processes, constraints).
- Use analysis tools:
    - Context Diagrams
    - Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)
    - ERD
    - Business/Technical Systems Options (BSOs/TSOs).
### 2.2 Requirements Traceability:

- Create a **traceability matrix** to link requirements to feature, design, test cases, and implementation.
- Track requirements across SDLC stages and analyze changes.

### 2.3 Software Quality:

- Apply two approaches (e.g., manual/automated testing, peer code review) to ensure quality.

### 2.4 Prototype:

- Develop a functional prototype with two core features from distinct modules (e.g., authentication and booking).
- Use technologies like:
    - HTML/CSS/JavaScript,
    - PHP/Python/Node.js,
    - MySQL/MongoDB.
- Deploy locally (e.g., XAMPP) or on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku).

### 2.5 Behavioural Design Techniques:

- Apply flowcharts, pseudocode, or Finite State Machine (FSMs).
- Compare FSMs vs. Extended FSMs and evaluate their suitability.

### 2.6 Data-Driven Approaches:
- Justify how they enhance scalability, adaptability, and error reduction.

## 3. Deliverables:

### 3.1 System Implementation and Evaluation Report:

- Structure report covering:
    - Systems investigation (requirements, scope, analysis tools).
    - Prototype details (features, technologies, deployment).
    - Traceability matrix and requirement tracking.
    - Software quality approaches (testing, peer review).
    - Evaluation of investigation (strengths, weeknesses, recommendations).
    - Behavioural design techniques (flowcharts, pseudocode, FSMs).
    - Comparison of FSMs vs. Extended FSMs.
    - Data-driven approach justifications.
- Use Harvard referencing for research.

### 3.2 Formal Presentation:

- 10-20 slides summarizing findings, quality approaches, behavioural techniques, and data-driven benefits.
- Include speaker notes and a live prototype demo.

### 3.3 Prototype:

- Functional, interactive prototype demonstrating two distinct module features.
- Deployed and documented with screenshots or code snippets.

## 4. Activities and Steps:

### Activity 3: Undertake SDLC:

- Conduct systems investigation (requirements, scope, tools).
- Develop and deploy a prototype.
- Trace requirements via a matrix.
- Apply quality approaches (testing, peer review).
- Evaluate investigation effectiveness.

### Activity 4: Behavioural Design Techniques:

- Discuss techniques (flowcharts, pseudocode, FSMs).
- Analyze tools (event-driven, state-driven, formal specifications).
- Compare FSMs vs. Extended FSMs.
- Justify data-driven approaches.

# Purpose of Deliverables

- **Report**: Documents the SDLC process, ensuring stakeholder requirements are met and providing evidence of investigation and design.
- **Presentation**: Communicates findings to technical and stakeholder audiences, a key professional skill.
- **Prototype**: Demonstrates practical implementation, validating design and functionality in a realistic context.
